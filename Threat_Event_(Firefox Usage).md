 # Threat Event (Suspicious Firefox Behavior)
**Unauthorized Firefox Browser Installation and Use**

 ## Steps the "Bad Actor" took to Create Logs and IoCs:
1. Download the Firefox browser installer: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/windows/
2. Install it manually: ```c:\users\sand\Downloads```
3. Opens the Firefox browser on the desktop
4. Connect to Firefox and browse a few sites.
   - Malicious site: ```http://malicious-website.com```
   - Malicious site: ```http://example.com/shell.php```
6. Create a file within the Programdata folder called ```eicar.ps1``` using PowerShell.
7. Made an unsuccessful attempt to download a file named ```exploit-kit.zip``` using PowerShell.
